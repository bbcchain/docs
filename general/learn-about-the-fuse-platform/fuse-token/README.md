# Butane Token (BBC)

The BBC token is the native currency of the Butane blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## BBC utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Butane blockchain, BBC is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Butane to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.bbcscan.io/](https://status.bbcscan.io/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked BBC. Which means validators with higher amounts of Butane staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any BBC holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of BBC they wish. They receive a share of the Butane block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As BBC is the native currency on Butane, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, BBC transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of BBC tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Butane platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
