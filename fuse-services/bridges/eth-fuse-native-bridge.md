# Butane: Ethereum â†” Butane

Butane native bridge between Ethereum and Butane is used to relay the Butane native token from Butane to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Butane bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Butane tokens between the Butane chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Butane or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Butane tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Butane chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Butane chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Butane chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Butane chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## Contracts

Home side of the bridge on the Butane network: [0xd617774b9708F79187Dc7F03D3Bdce0a623F6988](https://bbcscan.io/address/0xd617774b9708F79187Dc7F03D3Bdce0a623F6988/transactions)

Foreign side of the bridge on the Ethereum network: [0xC226f0AeA65942AB94434997bd0B98b30FF1d53d](https://bbcscan.io/address/0xC226f0AeA65942AB94434997bd0B98b30FF1d53d/transactions)

## How to use

On Butane you send native Butane token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Butane token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Butane token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Butane native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
